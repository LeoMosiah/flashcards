## Layers

### Data Access Layer (data):

The data layer is responsible for connecting the application to the outside world, all data that is accessed from the outside of the application or oblivion outside the application passes here. In this project all data is handled with React Native AssynStorage.

### Business Logic Layer(domain):

The domain layer is responsible for knowing the business rules, knowing how the graphical interface should respond to a certain user action. In this project this layer was constructed using redux for the synchronous logics and redux-saga for asynchronous.

### User interface(presentation):

The presentation layer is responsible for determining what should be presented to the user. In this project this layer was built using the react and react-native.
